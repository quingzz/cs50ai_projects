## Table of content

| Project name  | Lecture |Topic(s)    |   Description|
|---------------|---|-------------|--------------|

| Tic-tac-toe   |0  |Minimax (with $\alpha$, $\beta$ pruning)|Apply adversarial search to find optimal move in Tic-tac-toe  |
|Knights        |1  | Logical inference  | Represent problem statements as propositional logic in knowledge base, runs inference to determine true statements|  
|Minesweeper    |1  |Logical inference| Model problem, define inference rules to choose optimal move in Minesweeper|
|Page Rank      |2  |Markov Chain|Ranking pages' relevance by modelling their relations as a Markov Chain, using both Sampling and Iterative method|
|Heredity       |2  |Probability|Compute probability of inheriting trait (by computing joint probability of a Markov model)|
|Crossword      |3  |CSP (Constraint Satisfactory Problem)|Model crossword puzzles as CSP problem and apply AC-3 to find appropriate assignment|
|Shopping       |4  |Machine Learning (KNN)|Classify customer who likely to complete a purchase using KNN model|
|Nim            |4  |Q-Learning|Train AI agent to win Nim game|
|Traffic        |5  |Deep Learning (CNN)|Train CNN model to detect traffic signs|
|Parser         |6  |NLP (pre-processing/ chunking)|Define grammatical rulse to parse sentences as a tree|
|Questions      |6  |NLP (tf-idf)|Return sentences most related to query based on their idf values|
